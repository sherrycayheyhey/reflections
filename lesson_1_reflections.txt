How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see a bug that
was introduced?
The diff showed only the lines that were changed between the two files so that
narrowed down the number of lines that I had to looked at so I was able to save
a lot of time combing through the hundreds of lines of code. Since a bug was
introduced that wasn't there before, I knew that it would show up in one of the
differences that the terminal would show me.
