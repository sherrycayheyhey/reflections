When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository when I had work that I actually wanted to keep! Storing files only 
locally is a recipe for disaster and saving the files at a place like GitHub is like an insurance 
policy. This would also be extremely helpful in situations where I want to share my work or work
on a project with one or more other people.
